## 扩展prompt

Identify cell types of human PBMCs using the following markers. Identify one primary cell type for each cluster. If a cluster is likely a mixture of multiple cell types, specify the primary cell type and mention the possible mixture. For unknown clusters, label them as "unknown". Use marker databases or reference datasets for validation and provide a brief justification or reference for each identified cell type.

Markers:

cluster0: RASAL2, TRAT1, MAL, INPP4B, MYC, LEF1, BCL2, PRKCA, BCL11B, TNFRSF25, TRABD2A, TESPA1, IL7R, LTB, MDFIC

cluster1: GZMH, CCL5, KLRG1, CD8A, FCRL6, A2M, PZP, CST7, GZMA, ADGRG1, C1orf21, NKG7, LYAR, CD8B2, MYBL1

My goal is to identify each cluster as accurately as possible.
